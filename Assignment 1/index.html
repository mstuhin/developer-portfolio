            <p>it's been another demanding year for organisations in an environment beset by the by the pandemic,
                economic
                uncertainty and, more latterly, intensifying supply chain issues and disruptio. if anything supply
                chain issues and disruptio. if anything, 2021 has been just as tough as 2020 was!

                Thinking back to this time last year, most of us were looking forward to getting out of 2020 and hoping
                that
                2021 would be a more normal year, it wasn't. And it seems likely that 2022 will not be straightforward
                either;
